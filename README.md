Hi! This is ToniSaurio & Dokman project, forked from MopCore547 repository: https://github.com/MoPSource/MopCore547

This full project is here thanks to lots of people, including TrinityCore and MoPCore547.

As this is a Gpl project we want to continue with this great idea in the same way, everybody can enjoy this sourcecode as the same way we enjoy the original one :)

We are based in 5.4.7 Mists of Pandaria but is playable in 5.4.8 (Need to investigate further more here)

**ROAD MAP**

-Try to fix some important bugs and make the repository even more playable than it was forked.

-We love CUSTOM, so we are gonna add new content trying to make it fit with official content.

This is gonna be most detailed in the future :)

You can find the original repository information BELOW
